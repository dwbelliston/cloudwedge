# Services

All the supported services come with some default configurations. These defaults are designed to get you most of the way there but of course there will be times when you need to tweak the values to get more out of CloudWedge.

This section of the documentation is going to list all the services that CloudWedge supports along with the default configurations for that service. The supported services are grouped by the same domains found in the AWS console services list.
